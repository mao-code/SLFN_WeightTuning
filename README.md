# Note
* The different between weight adjustment and weight tuning
  * In machine learning, "weight adjustment" refers to the process of adjusting the weights in a neural network during training using backpropagation to minimize the loss function on the training data. This is a fundamental step in training a neural network.
  
  * On the other hand, "weight tuning" refers to the process of adjusting the weights in a neural network to improve its performance. This can involve adjusting hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, regularization, as well as adjusting the network's structure such as adding/deleting neurons, adjusting layer size, changing activation functions, etc. These adjustments are made outside of the training process and can be evaluated using techniques such as cross-validation to assess the model's performance.
  
  * In summary, "weight adjustment" emphasizes adjusting weights during training, while "weight tuning" emphasizes adjusting weights to improve the model's performance through model design and hyperparameter tuning.
